# Territory Manager

Address management software for ministry work in the Spanish field. Makes it much easier to maintain territories, or lists of addresses, used by volunteers. Data is easily updateable and exported to a document that can be adjusted and printed with Excel.

This was my first real project. I developed it in 2011 on VB.NET as a Windows Forms app. It is now legacy code that is maintained until replaced with a more modern and better designed solution. However, the software is reliable and still being actively used.
